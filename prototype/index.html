		student-run organizations and affiliation groups that support social, academic, athletic, and religious activities
		and interests. Some of the services offered by the UA Little Rock Office of Campus Life are intramural sports and
		fitness programs, diversity programs, leadership development, peer tutoring, student government association, student
		support programs including groups for non-traditional and first-generation students, a student-run newspaper, and

	<p>
		UA Little Rock's 14 athletic teams are known as the Little Rock Trojans, with almost all teams participating in the
		Sun Belt Conference. Little Rock is one of two Sun Belt members that do not sponsor football (UT Arlington being the
		other); UA Little Rock last fielded a football team in 1955 when it was known as Little Rock Junior College. Little
		Rock's main athletic offices are located in the Jack Stephens Center. UA Little Rock offers the following sports:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Baseball</li>
		<li>Men's and Women's Basketball</li>
		<li>Men's and Women's Golf</li>
		<li>Women's Volleyball</li>
		<li>Women's Soccer</li>
		<li>Women's Swimming/Diving</li>
		<li>Men's and Women's Cross Country</li>
		<li>Men's and Women's Track and Field (Indoor and Outdoor)</li>
		<li>Men's wrestling</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Two Little Rock teams that do not compete in the Sun Belt are the women's swimming and diving team (Missouri Valley
		Conference) and wrestling (Pac-12 Conference), neither of which the Sun Belt sponsors. Wrestling is the school's
		newest sport, starting in 2019, and is the first Division I program in Arkansas.
	</p>

	<p>
		Little Rock will move to the Ohio Valley Conference for the 2022&ndash;23 season.
